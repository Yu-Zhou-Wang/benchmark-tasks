## Overview

Agents that work in a chemistry lab need more than meshes. They need to know that a fume-hood sash travels 673 mm and
stops at 457 mm, that moving a balance's draft-shield door restarts its stability check, and which quantities a policy
may observe and which are hidden ground truth kept for evaluation. ChemLab-Assets ships that knowledge with the geometry,
for robots that operate the instruments by hand and for LLM agents that run them from a command line.

Each asset is one specific commercial instrument, chosen from a survey of 200 instruments and modules used in university
chemistry teaching and research, and built from published brochures, manuals and papers. The models reproduce documented
behaviour.

This dataset holds everything: models, contracts, runtimes, tests and the catalog. The code is mirrored on [GitHub](https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/ChemLab-Assets); see also the [Project website](https://mbzuai-nlp.github.io/ChemLab-Assets/).

## Two ways to use ChemLab

Each instrument runs on one behaviour model. A robot can work it by hand, or an LLM agent can work it from a shell, and
the instrument behaves the same either way.

| | Embodied mode | Agentic mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Who acts** | a robot in a 3D simulator | an LLM agent in a shell |
| **How it acts** | opens doors and lids, presses keys, turns knobs, taps touchscreens, grasps bottles and plates | `chemlab` commands |
| **What it sees** | camera images, including the instrument screens | text replies, readings and screenshots of the screens |
| **What you need** | a simulator: Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab, or any URDF loader | Python on Linux, no GPU |

### Embodied mode: robots operate the instruments

Every instrument is a 3D model with working joints (doors, lids, sashes, keys, knobs), grasp and place points, and
colliders. On the 106 instruments with a front panel, the screen is drawn by the instrument's own menu engine, so a
robot sees the result of what it pressed. All 203 instruments were converted to USD and run in NVIDIA Isaac Sim through
the Matterix framework, where a robot arm pressed a key or tapped the screen on 97 front panels.

<p align="center"><img src="media/figs/joints_motion.webp" width="820" alt="Four instruments at the start and end of a joint move: the Esco fume-hood sash raised, the IKA RV 10 lift raised with its glassware, the Rigaku XtaLAB Synergy-R doors opened and its goniometer turned, and the Quantos doors opened"></p>
<p align="center"><sub>Joints of the shipped models, start (top) and end (bottom): (1) Esco fume-hood sash up 450 mm; (2) IKA RV 10 lift up
140 mm, glassware included; (3) Rigaku XtaLAB Synergy-R doors open, goniometer turned (omega 69°, kappa −63°, phi 180°)
and detector moved; (4) Quantos front and side doors open.</sub></p>

New in 1.5.0, the lab has its supplies: 62 models of specific products, from DURAN screw-cap bottles, vials, tubes,
well plates and Opentrons tip racks to a reagent shelf, safety cabinets, a refrigerator and a desiccator. Caps are
separate parts, and every container records its grasp points and inside volume. A table of 239 substances gives their
hazard codes and storage classes.

<p align="center"><img src="media/figs/isaac_storage_lab.webp" width="820" alt="The storage room of our Isaac Sim lab: safety cabinets and refrigerators, the robot bench with a reagent shelf, the robot at the shelf, and gas cylinders"></p>

bench with the reagent shelf; (3) the robot reaching into the shelf; (4) gas cylinders by a cylinder stand.</sub></p>

The instruments' behaviour models run inside the scene, so the balance reading, the hotplate temperature, the reaction
and the powder dose all come from them. Two robot workflows in our Isaac Sim lab:

<p align="center"><img src="media/figs/isaac_workflow_esterification.webp" width="820" alt="Four key frames of a robot esterification in Isaac Sim: acetic acid (amber) pouring onto ethanol (blue) in the reaction beaker, the balance reading 191.8 g, the beaker on the IKA hotplate, and the hotplate after heating at 300 rpm"></p>

**Esterification.** (1) The robot pours 50 mL of ethanol and then 40 mL of acetic acid into the reaction beaker; 89.3 mL
arrive. The liquids are simulated as particles and tinted so they show up (ethanol blue, acetic acid amber; both are
really colourless). (2) The OHAUS balance reads 191.8 g. (3) The robot sets the beaker on the IKA hotplate. (4) The
hotplate heats with a 70 °C set point and stirs at 300 rpm; after 200 s the liquid is at 77 °C and 1.91 g of ethyl
acetate has formed.

<p align="center"><img src="media/figs/isaac_workflow_quantos.webp" width="820" alt="Four key frames of robot powder dosing with the Quantos in Isaac Sim: the dosing head going into its holder, a vial on the weighing pan, the finished dose, and the vial back in the rack"></p>

**Powder dosing with the Quantos.** (1) The robot slides a potassium bromide dosing head into the Quantos. (2) It sets an
empty vial on the weighing pan. (3) The Quantos closes its doors and doses 50.000 mg, exactly the target. (4) The robot
puts the vial back in the rack.

The robot scenes were built with Matterix, which is not part of this release. ChemLab-Assets ships the instruments,
labware and behaviour models they load.

### Agentic mode: chemlab, a command line for LLM agents

`chemlab` puts the whole lab behind one shell command. An agent lists the instruments, reads their help, sets them up,
runs them and reads the results, as a person would at the bench. Time in the lab moves only when the agent waits.

<p align="center"><img src="media/figs/chemlab_tour.webp" width="820" alt="A chemlab session: list the lab, set a hotplate to 80 °C, start heating, wait 600 s, read 80.2 °C, and an out-of-range set point refused with a fix"></p>

* **Plain commands for each kind of instrument.** `chemlab run` gives each of 30 instrument classes (balances, temperature
  control, pipetting, chromatography and more) one set of verbs, with units, range checks and named positions.
  `chemlab call` reaches every capability in an instrument's contract.
* **Errors that say what to do.** Each error says what is wrong, how to fix it and whether the instrument changed.
* **A stocked lab.** The default lab starts with all 203 instruments ready, 97 containers on shelves and in cabinets
  (solvents, buffers, certified standards, plates, gas cylinders) and 189 items already loaded in the instruments.
  `chemlab list --inventory` shows what is where.
* **Ready for evaluation.** An agent sees only what the instrument shows; true values are kept for evaluators. Its shell
  runs in a sandbox that reaches nothing but `chemlab`. The basic commands (list, describe, call, read, wait, screen and
  more) also work as MCP tools.

**A complete task.** 276 tasks come with automatic checkers. Each gives the agent an instruction in plain words; the checker
then reads the instrument's own state, so writing the right answer is not enough. Below, an agent verifies a water-activity
meter against a certified standard. The meter is still warming up, nothing has been measured, and the chamber lever is
open. The agent fixes each problem from the error message alone.

<p align="center"><img src="media/figs/chemlab_task.webp" width="820" alt="A complete chemlab task: the AQUALAB 4TE verification, three refused commands each fixed from the error message, the standard measured at aw 0.8821, verification passed, and the checker's PASS"></p>

**Screens as images.** An agent can also work the front panel like a person, with keys and knobs only. A gesture reports
only whether the instrument accepted it, so the agent looks at the display to see what happened. `chemlab screen` saves
the display as a PNG for a vision-language model to read.

<p align="center"><img src="media/figs/chemlab_panel.webp" width="820" alt="A chemlab session that sets an IKA hotplate by turning its knobs, then saves its LCD as plate.png showing 80.2 °C and 240 rpm"></p>

**Try it.**

```bash
cd ChemLab-Assets/chemlab
python -m chemlab.gserve --only ika_plate_rctdigital mt_xpr204e --shell    # a sandboxed shell with two instruments
python -m chemlab.tasks list                                               # the 276 tasks
python -m chemlab.tasks shell pm04_recover_aw_verify                       # do a task yourself; the checker runs when you exit
python -m chemlab.tasks run pm04_recover_aw_verify --solution my_agent.sh  # or score your agent's commands
```

The full command reference is in [`chemlab/README.md`](chemlab/README.md).

## Front-panel menus

106 of the 203 instruments have a working front panel: the keys, knobs, switches and touchscreens of the
real instrument, and the screens and menus its manual describes (58 touchscreens, 28 text-menu displays and
20 simple displays that step through settings). A menu runs on the instrument's own behaviour model, so a setting
changed in the menu changes the simulated instrument, and the screen shows the result.

<p align="center"><img src="media/figs/menu_preview_aqualab.webp" width="760" alt="Six screens of the AquaLab 4TE: the measurement screen, the configuration menu, the temperature item selected, the temperature editor at 25.0 and 25.1 °C, and the menu with the saved value"></p>
<p align="center"><sub>Changing the measuring temperature of the AquaLab 4TE water-activity meter in its menu: MENU, down, ENTER, up, SAVE.</sub></p>

**Preview menu steps.** Name an instrument and a list of steps. The script presses, turns or touches as told, saves the
screen after each step and puts the frames into one strip image:

```bash
python examples/preview_menu.py aqualab_4te btn3=MENU down btn2=ENTER up btn2=SAVE
python examples/preview_menu.py mt_xpr204e --list       # keys, knobs, displays and the buttons on screen
python examples/preview_menu.py mt_xpr204e tap:Methods tap:Tests tap:Close
```

A step is a key (`menu_key`, or `press:menu_key:2` to hold it for 2 s), `turn:knob_speed:+3`, `switch:power_switch:on`,
`touch:terminal:400,240` or `tap:Methods` on a touchscreen, or `wait:5`. The frames go to `menu_preview/<instrument>/`.

**For agents.** The same gestures are capabilities in each contract. `panel.press`, `panel.turn`, `panel.switch` and
`panel.touch` perform one gesture and only report whether the instrument accepted it, so an agent has to read the screen
to see what happened. `panel.capture` returns the image of a display, as a camera pointed at it would see it.
`panel.frame` returns the structured screen (page, menu position, values) and is for evaluators only. Each instrument's
`panel_ui.json` describes its screens and menus and cites the manufacturer's documents for each of them.

**Checked in Isaac Sim.** All 106 front panels were checked in Isaac Sim through the Matterix framework: the rendered
screen matches the menu engine, and keys, knobs and touchscreens drive the menu in each simulated copy separately. A robot
arm pressed a key or tapped the screen on 97 of them.

## Request an instrument

Missing an instrument from your lab? [Open an instrument request](https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/ChemLab-Assets/issues/new?template=instrument_request.yml) and tell us the maker and model.
Manuals, brochures, photos from several sides and a few lines on how you use it help us build an accurate model.
Please only attach files you are allowed to share; for the manufacturer's public documents a link is enough.

## Quick start

**1. Get the data.** Everything (about 1.9 GB), or one instrument plus the code:

```bash
pip install -U huggingface_hub
hf download MBZUAI/ChemLab-Assets --repo-type dataset --local-dir ChemLab-Assets
pip install -r ChemLab-Assets/requirements.txt   # NumPy 2.0–2.3, SciPy, Pillow, OpenCV, CoolProp, pytest

hf download MBZUAI/ChemLab-Assets --repo-type dataset --local-dir ChemLab-Assets \
    --include "assets/expansion_batch05/t2_vacuum/esco_efa5uduvw/*" "scripts/*" "examples/*"
```

`catalog/catalog.csv` gives every instrument's folder, so any subset can be fetched the same way. Run the test suite
with `python -m pytest` from the dataset root (tests that re-hash cached third-party source files skip themselves,
because those files are not redistributed).

**2. Run an instrument.** The fume hood below starts with an uncalibrated airflow monitor. The robot raises the sash,
sees a low reading, measures the opening with an anemometer and calibrates the monitor. It never sees the true face
velocity (0.299 m/s), which is an evaluator-only slot. Full script: [`examples/quickstart_fume_hood.py`](examples/quickstart_fume_hood.py).

```python
from asset_runtime import esco_efa5uduvw as rt   # run from the repo root with scripts/ on sys.path

hood = rt.EscoEfa5uduvwRuntime("hood_01")
hood.register_principal("lab", "evaluator")    # sets up the world, sees hidden truth
hood.register_principal("robot", "agent")      # sees what a policy may see
lab, robot = hood.session("lab"), hood.session("robot")

call(lab, "plant.configure", **rt.PLANT_EXAMPLE)        # 295.15 K, 101.325 kPa
call(lab, "exhaust.configure", **rt.EXHAUST_EXAMPLE)    # building exhaust, damper half open
call(robot, "sash.set", height_m=0.457)                  # raise to the 18-inch stop
call(lab, "sim.step", dt_s=30.0)
show("before calibration")

v = call(robot, "anemometer.measure")["face_velocity_m_s"]
call(robot, "monitor.calibrate", reference_m_s=round(v, 3))
call(lab, "sim.step", dt_s=10.0)
show("after calibration")
```

```text
before calibration   reading 0.28 m/s   alarm low
anemometer           0.309 m/s
after calibration    reading 0.31 m/s   alarm none
```

**3. Load it in a simulator.** URDF mesh paths are relative, so any URDF loader works from the asset folder. All 203
URDFs load with [yourdfpy](https://github.com/clemense/yourdfpy):

```python
import yourdfpy
hood = yourdfpy.URDF.load("assets/expansion_batch05/t2_vacuum/esco_efa5uduvw/model.urdf")
hood.update_cfg({"sash_joint": 0.45})   # raise the sash 450 mm
hood.show()
```

For Isaac Lab, convert `model.urdf` with the Isaac Lab URDF importer. GLB files keep the Z-up asset frame; rotate −90° about
X in Y-up viewers (the catalog's `glb_up` column says which files need it).

**4. Run the lab as an agent.** Start `chemlab` as shown in [Agentic mode](#agentic-mode-chemlab-a-command-line-for-llm-agents).

## What an asset contains

```text
assets/expansion_batch05/t2_vacuum/esco_efa5uduvw/
├── asset.contract.json      # the contract: components, joints, state slots, capabilities, sources, limitations
├── model.glb                # viewing (asset frame: Z up, front faces −Y)
├── model.urdf               # simulators: links, joints with limits, primitive collision proxies
├── meshes/                  # one OBJ + MTL per functional part (78 files here)
├── textures/                # panel, label and screen textures drawn for the model
├── model.blend              # Blender source with named parts
├── geometry_manifest.json   # parts, frames, dimensions and joint layout
├── collision_proxies.json   # primitive colliders per part
├── instrument_model.json    # runtime parameters (this instrument)
├── vapour_templates.json    # reference data used by the runtime (53 vapour sources)
├── panel_ui.json            # front panel: keys, displays, screens and menus
└── 说明.md                  # notes on the model and its data (Chinese)

scripts/asset_runtime/esco_efa5uduvw.py   # the behaviour runtime
scripts/asset_runtime/_panel_ui.py        # the shared front-panel engine
tests/test_asset_esco_efa5uduvw.py        # its tests (and tests/test_panel_ui_esco_efa5uduvw.py)
```

The contract is the centre of each asset. It names every functional **component** and binds it to meshes and colliders;
lists **state slots** with type, unit, range, origin (setpoint, sensor, derived, process truth) and visibility (agent,
evaluator, debug); defines **capabilities** with JSON-Schema arguments, preconditions, state effects, declared errors and
a verification level for process, host, scene, robot and hardware; and records **mechanisms**, **ports**, **sources** and
**limitations**. The specification is in [`skills/chemistry-lab-assets/references/contract.md`](skills/chemistry-lab-assets/references/contract.md)
and the call protocol in [`protocol.md`](skills/chemistry-lab-assets/references/protocol.md) (both in Chinese); the
validator is `skills/chemistry-lab-assets/scripts/asset_tool.py`.

## Provenance, licences and limits

* **Sources.** Each state slot and capability lists the sources it rests on: manufacturer documents for dimensions,
  ranges and limits; papers, standards and open databases for the measurements behind instrument outputs; explicit
  assumptions where neither exists. Raw third-party documents (PDF manuals, brochures, application notes, papers,
  spectra files, photos) are not redistributed; contracts keep the citations and derived values.
* **Licences.** Code is MIT ([`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). Models, contracts and data are CC BY-NC 4.0
  ([`LICENSE-ASSETS.md`](LICENSE-ASSETS.md)). Some data files carry their source's terms (CC BY-SA, non-commercial, or
  rights reserved by the publisher); [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) lists every one with its source.
* **Trademarks.** Product and company names identify the modelled instrument only. This project is not affiliated
  with or endorsed by any manufacturer.
* **Limits.** 787 capabilities are declared but marked unsupported. Contracts do not claim robot-contact or
  real-hardware validation for any capability; the robot actions shown above were made in simulation, and `chemlab` drives
  the behaviour models, not real instruments. Treat the assets as documented, testable behaviour models for embodied-AI
  and agent research, not as certified digital twins.
* **Build records.** Contracts list the files of the original build (validation logs, review records, cached source
  documents). Those are not part of the release; `release_manifest.json` says which artifacts ship.
